## BookAPI

This project is a simplified version of the course API as it currently lacks a UI. I plan to complete the UI by tomorrow. However, it was cool to revisit and build it from scratch.

### What I Learned

- **First time using GitBash:** It took me some time to learn all the commands, but now I can upload to GitHub directly from the terminal without using the web interface. GitBash seems pretty useful, and I definitely plan to learn more as I work on additional projects in the future.

- **Using SQLiteStudio:** I used SQLiteStudio as the database tool for this project, and it went smoothly. It’s much cleaner than pgAdmin4. I uploaded the file generated in PyCharm, and it worked perfectly—no need to tweak anything. I initially planned to upload the project to Heroku for hosting, which is why there's an extra file named Procfile with some text i'll delete it later. However, I found out that Heroku requires payment, so I kept the setup as is. All the CRUD commands work fine for now, and tomorrow I'll check if the UI affects anything.

  ```gitbash
  I also used `git push --force` because I couldn't figure out how to merge the branches I had (main and master). I wanted all the code to be in the main branch but kept getting an error. I need to learn how to do this without potentially deleting someone else's work since I've read that `git push --force` can cause that.
  ```

Overall, this project has been a great learning experience, and I'm looking forward to enhancing it further.
